This will help avoid confusion with similar-looking parts of different sub-assemblies being on your workbench at the same time.<br></li><li class="atten3">The component groups are inspected and repaired from the converter housing side.<br></li><li class="atten3">Whenever possible, complete the inspection, repair and reassembly before proceeding to the next component group. If a defect is found in a certain component group during reassembly, inspect and repair this group immediately. If a component group cannot be assembled because parts are being ordered, be sure to keep all parts of the group in a separate container while proceeding with disassembly, inspection, repair and reassembly of other component groups.<br></li><li class="atten3">Use of Toyota Genuine ATF WS is recommended.<br></li><li class="atten3">All disassembled parts should be washed clean, and compressed air should be blown through any fluid passages and holes.<br></li><li class="atten3">Dry all parts with compressed air. Never use a cloth.<br></li><li class="atten3">The recommended ATF or kerosene should be used for cleaning.<br></li><li class="atten3">After cleaning, the parts should be arranged in the order they were removed for efficient inspection, repairs and reassembly.<br></li><li class="atten3">New discs for the brakes and clutches that will be used for replacement must be soaked in ATF for at least 15 minutes before reassembly.<br></li><li class="atten3">All oil seal rings, clutch discs, clutch plates, rotating parts and sliding surfaces should be coated with ATF prior to reassembly.<br></li><li class="atten3">All old gaskets and rubber O-rings must be replaced.<br></li><li class="atten3">Do not apply adhesive cement to gaskets and similar parts.<br></li><li class="atten3">Make sure that the ends of the snap rings are not aligned with any cutouts. Also make sure that snap rings are correctly installed into the grooves.<br></li><li class="atten3">If a worn bushing is to be replaced, the sub-assembly containing the bushing must also be replaced.<br></li><li class="atten3">Check the thrust bearings and races for wear or damage. Replace them if necessary.<br></li><li class="atten3">Use petroleum jelly to keep parts in place.<br></li><li class="atten3">When working with FIPG material, perform the following:<br>Using a razor blade and gasket scraper, remove all old FIPG material from the gasket surface.<br>Clean all components thoroughly to remove all foreign matter.<br>Clean both sealing surfaces with a non-residue solvent.<br>Apply FIPG material in a continuous line on the sealing surface.<br>Reassemble parts within 10 minutes of applying FIPG material. Failing to do so will require the FIPG material to be removed and reapplied.<br></li></ol></p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
