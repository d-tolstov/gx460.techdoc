In general, ECU controlled systems are considered to be very intricate, requiring a high level of technical knowledge to troubleshoot. However, most problem checking procedures only involve inspecting the ECU controlled system's circuits one by one. An adequate understanding of the system and a basic knowledge of electricity is enough to perform effective troubleshooting, accurate diagnoses and necessary repairs.<br></li></ol><br clear="all"><a name="RM14K0E___00002210000011step"></a><table cellspacing="0" border="1" width="100%"><tr><td class="s1">TROUBLESHOOTING PROCEDURES</td></tr></table><font class="ptxt"></font><ol style="list-style-type: disc"><li class="itm">The troubleshooting procedures consist of diagnosis procedures for when a DTC is stored and diagnosis procedures for when no DTC is stored. The basic idea is explained in the following table.<br><br class="beforePng" clear="all"><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="89.5%"><colgroup align="" width="33%

Therefore, a process of elimination is used, where components that can be inspected individually are inspected, and if no problems are found in these components, the related ECU is identified as the problem and replaced.<br></li><li class="itm">It is extremely important to ask the customer about the environment and the conditions present when the problem occurred (Customer Problem Analysis). This makes it possible to simulate the conditions and confirm the symptom. If the symptom cannot be confirmed or the DTC does not recur, the malfunctioning part may not be identified using the troubleshooting procedure, and the ECU for the related system may be replaced even though it is not defective. If this happens, the original problem will not be solved.<br></li><li class="itm">In order to prevent endless expansion of troubleshooting procedures, the troubleshooting procedures are written with the assumption that multiple malfunctions do not occur simultaneously for a single problem symptom. <br></li><li class="itm">To identify the malfunctioning part, troubleshooting procedures narrow down the target by separating components, ECUs and wire harnesses during the inspection. If the wire harness is identified as the cause of the problem, it is necessary to inspect not only the connections to components and ECUs but also all of the wire harness connectors between the component and the ECU. <br></li></ol><br clear="all"><a name="RM14K0E___00002210000012step"></a><table cellspacing="0" border="1" width="100%"><tr><td class="s1">DESCRIPTION</td></tr></table><font class="ptxt">System data and the Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) can be read from the Data Link Connector 3 (DLC3) of the vehicle.
