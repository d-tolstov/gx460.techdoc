<li><p><font class="ptxt">In conjunction with the impact absorbing structure for a front collision, the SRS (Supplemental Restraint System) steering pad, instrument panel passenger airbag, lower No. 1 instrument panel airbag and lower No. 2 instrument panel airbag are designed to supplement seat belts in the event of a front collision in order to help reduce shock to the head, chest and knees of the driver and front passenger. This system is a 3-sensor type airbag system which detects the impact during a front collision using the center airbag sensor and front airbag sensors. It also operates the airbag system and seat belt pretensioners.</font><br></p></li>
<li><p><font class="ptxt">This vehicle is equipped with electrical-type deceleration sensors for the front airbags in order to detect details about the extent of a collision during the initial stages of the collision. Therefore, the deployment of the driver airbag and instrument panel passenger airbag is controlled in two stages according to the severity of the impact.</font><br></p></li>
<li><p><font class="ptxt">In conjunction with the impact absorbing structure for a side collision, the seat side airbag and curtain shield airbag are designed to help reduce shock to the driver, front passenger and rear outer passengers in the event of a side collision.</font><br></p></li>
<li><p><font class="ptxt">The curtain shield airbag helps reduce shock to the front and rear seat occupants. In conjunction with the curtain shield airbag, side airbag sensors are installed at the bottom of the front doors and rear airbag sensors are installed at the bottom of the rear pillars.</font><br></p></li>
<li><p><font class="ptxt">In this system, a front side collision is detected by the side airbag sensor in order to simultaneously deploy the front seat and curtain shield airbags. A rear side collision is detected by the rear airbag sensor and the center airbag sensor in order to deploy the curtain shield airbag.</font><br></p></li>
<li><p><font class="ptxt">The center airbag sensor sends the airbag deployment signal to the ECM through the CAN (Controller Area Network) to operate the fuel pump control.</font><br></p></li>
<li><p><font class="ptxt">The center airbag sensor sends the airbag deployment signal to the main body ECU via the discrete line to operate collision door lock release control.</font><br></p></li></ol><br clear="all"><a name="RM14K0E___000060V0000012step"></a><table cellspacing="0" border="1" width="100%"><tr><td class="s1">CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION</td></tr></table><font class="ptxt"></font>
