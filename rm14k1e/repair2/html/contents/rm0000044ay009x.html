The cruise control system cannot be set when the driving vehicle speed is below the low speed limit. The cruise control operation will be automatically canceled but the stored vehicle speed will be retained when the vehicle speed decreases below the low speed limit of 40 km/h (25 mph) while cruise control is in operation.</font><br></p></li>
<li><p><font class="ptxt">High speed limit</font><br><font class="ptxt">The upper limit of the speed setting range is set at approximately 200 km/h (125 mph). The cruise control system cannot be set when the driving vehicle speed is over the high speed limit. Also, +RES cannot be used to increase speed beyond the high speed limit.</font><br></p></li></ol><br clear="all"><a name="RM14K0E___0000B1E0000013step"></a><table cellspacing="0" border="1" width="100%"><tr><td class="s1">OPERATION OF CRUISE CONTROL</td></tr></table><font class="ptxt">The cruise control switch is used to operate 7 functions: SET, COAST, TAP-DOWN, RES (RESUME), ACCELERATION, TAP-UP and CANCEL. The SET, TAP-DOWN and COAST functions and the RES (RESUME), TAP-UP and ACCELERATION functions are operated with the same switch. The cruise control switch is an automatic return type switch which turns on only while holding it in each direction and turns off after releasing it.<br></font>
<ol class="s2">
<li><p><font class="ptxt">SET CONTROL</font><br><font class="ptxt">The vehicle speed is stored and constant speed control is initiated when pushing the switch to -SET while driving with the cruise control switch on (the cruise control indicator light and cruise control SET indicator light is on) and with the vehicle speed within the set speed range (between the low and high speed limits).</font><br></p></li>
<li><p><font class="ptxt">COAST CONTROL</font><br><font class="ptxt">When the cruise control switch is pushed to -SET and held in that position while the cruise control system is operating, the ECM sends a throttle valve opening angle 0&deg; demand signal to the throttle body. Then, the vehicle speed is stored and maintained when the cruise control switch is released.</font><br></p></li>
<li><p><font class="ptxt">TAP-DOWN CONTROL</font><br><font class="ptxt">When tapping down the cruise control switch to -SET (for approximately 0.6 seconds) while the cruise control system is in operation, the stored vehicle speed decreases each time by approximately 1.6 km/h (1.0 mph). However, when the difference between the driving and stored vehicle speeds is more than approximately 5 km/h (3 mph), the stored vehicle speed is set to the actual vehicle speed at the moment the cruise control switch is released from -SET and constant speed control is initiated.</font><br></p></li>
<li><p><font class="ptxt">ACCELERATION CONTROL</font><br><font class="ptxt">The throttle motor of the throttle body is instructed by the ECM to open the throttle valve when the cruise control switch is pushed to +RES and held while the cruise control system is in operation. When the cruise control switch is released from +RES, the vehicle speed is stored and the vehicle is controlled in order to maintain a constant speed.</font><br></p></li>
<li><p><font class="ptxt">TAP-UP CONTROL</font><br><font class="ptxt">When tapping up the cruise control switch to +RES (for approximately 0.6 seconds) while the cruise control system is in operation, the stored vehicle speed increases each time by approximately 1.6 km/h (1.0 mph). However, when the difference between the driving and the stored vehicle speed is more than approximately 5 km/h (3 mph), the stored vehicle speed will not be changed.</font><br></p></li>
<li><p><font class="ptxt">RES (RESUME) CONTROL</font><br><font class="ptxt">If cruise control operation is canceled with the stop light switch, CANCEL switch, etc., and if the driving speed is within the set speed range, pushing the cruise control switch to +RES restores the vehicle speed memorized at the time of cancellation, and initiates constant speed control.</font><br></p></li>
<li><p><font class="ptxt">SHIFT DOWN CONTROL (for Automatic Transmission)</font><br><ol style="list-style-type: disc"><li class="itm">Overdrive may be canceled automatically when using cruise control while driving on inclined roads, etc.<br></li><li class="itm">After overdrive is canceled, if the system determines that the road is no longer inclined based on the throttle valve opening amount, overdrive will be restored.<br></li><li class="itm">If overdrive is canceled during an ACCEL or RESUME operation, overdrive will be restored after the ACCEL or RESUME operation is completed.<br></li></ol></p></li>
