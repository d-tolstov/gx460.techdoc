<li><p><font class="ptxt">If there is a vehicle ahead in the same lane, the system maintains the vehicle distance that has been set by the driver. If the system detects a vehicle driving at a slower speed ahead while the driver is driving at a constant speed, it closes the throttle valve to decelerate. If further deceleration is required, the system controls the brake actuator in order to apply the brakes. Thereafter, if there are no vehicles ahead within the set vehicle-to-vehicle distance because either the vehicle ahead or the driver has changed lanes, the system accelerates slowly to reach the set vehicle speed and resumes driving at the constant speed.</font><br></p></li>
<li><p><font class="ptxt">The constant speed control mode is designed to maintain a constant cruising speed. The vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode is designed to control cruising using a constant speed function, deceleration cruising function, follow-up cruising function and acceleration cruising function.</font><br></p></li>
<li><p><font class="ptxt">The millimeter wave radar sensor assembly and driving support ECU control the system while the vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode is in operation and send signals to each actuator and ECU.</font><br></p></li>
<li><p><font class="ptxt">In vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode, the dynamic radar cruise control system receives signals from the yaw rate sensor and steering angle sensor. Based on these signals, it then estimates curve radius and corrects the information on the preceding vehicle while turning. It can also adjust the brake control when approaching another vehicle.</font><br></p></li>
<li><p><font class="ptxt">This system judges the presence of a vehicle in front and the distance to it based on the signals from the millimeter wave radar sensor while the vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode is in operation. Using this information, the system informs the driver of any danger with the warning buzzer, performs brake control and turns on the stop light when approaching the vehicle in front.</font><br></p></li><br clear="all" class="beforePng"><br clear="all" class="beforePng">
