Decelerate with the brake pedal or accelerate with the accelerator pedal according to the situation to keep an appropriate distance with the vehicle in front.<br></li><li class="itm">When the vehicle in front decelerates rapidly or another vehicle moves in front of your vehicle, decelerating in time to avoid a collision may not be possible without additional braking.<br></li><li class="itm">The dynamic radar cruise control system is designed to assist in maintaining an appropriate distance with the vehicle in front. However, the system alone is not sufficient. It is imperative that the driver pay attention at all times.<br></li><li class="itm">The millimeter wave radar sensor assembly has functions that automatically detect dirt on the sensor face and inform the driver. However, these functions are not perfect. Keep the sensor face clean.<br></li><li class="itm">The dynamic radar cruise control system does not operate or give a vehicle-approaching warning for vehicles which are stopped or driving at significantly slower speeds. Always pay attention to these vehicles.<br></li><li class="itm">The millimeter wave radar sensor assembly detection area is narrow at close range, so detection of a vehicle moving just in front may be delayed, or a motorcycle running on the side of the same lane may not be detected. The distance to the vehicle in front may not be maintained properly due to such reasons.<br></li><li class="itm">Even if ACCEL is operated to increase the set vehicle speed, the vehicle does not accelerate because the speed is controlled in accordance with the speed of the vehicle in front while driving with the vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode on (follow-up cruising). However, as the set vehicle speed has been increased by the ACCEL operation, the vehicle accelerates when there is no vehicle in front. Check the set speed with the set vehicle speed indication on the display.<br></li><li class="itm">The controlled vehicle distance may be shorter than the set vehicle distance when cruising on a long, downhill road.<br></li><li class="itm">The cruise control switch must be turned off and then on if all of the following occur: 1) the cruise control indicator light blinks, 2) the master warning light illuminates at the same time as a "pong" sound is heard, and 3) the fail message is shown on the display.<br></li><li class="itm">The vehicle-approaching warning buzzer does not sound in constant speed control mode because the presence of the vehicle in front and the distance to it are not judged as in the vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode. Pay attention to the distance to the vehicle in front.<br></li><li class="itm">The dynamic radar cruise control system has 2 cruise control modes: the constant speed control mode and vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode. Confirm which mode is selected when using the dynamic radar cruise control system.<br></li></ol><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></body></html>
